# BankSimul500
Project repository for school project. Projects idea was to work in teams to create a touch screen screen used ATM that had specified features and would work through MySQL server.

Project was written in C++ using QT. The work was split up for members using DLL's. I was responsible for tracking our teams progress and programming the MySQL part and "Service Timer" add-on.
